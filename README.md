# Adaptive Seascape
This tool plots adaptive landscape through time.

For example, below figure is showing the IC<sub>99.99</sub> values of TEM-1 beta-lactamase synonymous mutants. Each colored circle on top of cylinders show synonymous mutation(see legend on top left).Heigh of each cylinder here is normalized to IC<sub>99.99</sub> values of WT. Thus, WT composed on one gray disk. If a mutant has 2 gray disks meaning it has twice resistant to CTX than WT. Check the paper in the link for more details.

Next example, is from Ravikumar et al.[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418313308]. They evolved pfDHFR using their orthoRep system. In the paper (Figure 4) they showed the MIC values of 48 mutants. (Full combination of 6 mutations). This time height of the cylinders show the log<sub>10</sub> MIC (nM) median values. In the right most corner there is an extra cylinder with quadriple-mutation on it that is observed in patients with pyrimethamine resistant malaria.
