# Adaptive Seascape
This tool plots adaptive landscape through time.

For example, below figure is showing the IC<sub>99.99</sub> values of TEM-1 beta-lactamase synonymous mutants. Each colored circle on top of cylinders show synonymous mutation(see legend on top left).Heigh of each cylinder here is normalized to IC<sub>99.99</sub> values of WT. Thus, WT composed on one gray disk. If a mutant has 2 gray disks meaning it has twice resistant to CTX than WT. Check the paper in the link here for more details. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-018-0104-z
